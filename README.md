# gcd iteration & recursion

These are the two small exercises to practice iterative algorithms as part of MITx: 6.00.1x

### Task

Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

1. using an iterative algorithm
2. using recursion

### Solution

Find the largest positive inerger that divides both numbers leaving no remainder

1. To do this I used while loops to iterate through each number smaller then the smaller number given until a remainder of zero was reached

2. I used the Euclidean algorithm.
